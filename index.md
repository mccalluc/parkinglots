A little quiz on the parking lots of the world, the sites they serve.

These are all destinations: Some are sites of beauty,

Travel has costs, and most of these costs are not born by the travellers themselves.
We all know the carbon costs of travel, and the pain we will cause people whose lives have just begun.

and hesitate before starting a journey that requires paving a place for you at the end.
