A little quiz on the parking lots of the world, the sites they serve.

These are all destinations: Some are sites of beauty,
some commemorate the good, and others remind us of suffering. Each can be reached by car or bus: For some the parking lot is part of the site itself, covering a fraction of it; in other cases the lot is one point on the ceremonial axis, through to the ticket booth.

Travel has costs, and most of these costs are not born by the travellers themselves.
We all know the carbon costs of travel, and the pain we will cause people whose lives have just begun.
We should also remember the role of travel in the spread of disease. 
The casual assumption that travel is part of the lifestyle of the developed world is broken.

As you zoom out on each of these, trying to find some landmark you recognize,
treasure the corner of the world you can walk to,
and hesitate before starting a journey that requires paving a space for you at the far side.
