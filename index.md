A little quiz on the parking lots of the world, the sites they serve.

These are all destinations for visitors: Some are sites of natural beauty,
some commemorate the good we have done, and others remind us of the evil of which we are capable. Each of these can be reached by car or bus: For some the parking lot is part of the site itself, covering a fraction of it; in other cases the lot may be one line in a ceremonial axis, through the ticket booth, to the site beyond.

I began this as a little Christmas present, but pulling the pieces together prompted me to think a bit more about what travel means.
Travel has costs, and most of these costs are not born by the travellers themselves.
We all know the carbon costs of travel, and the suffering we impose on future generations, but this year has brought other costs to the fore.
The casual assumption that travel is part of the lifestyle of the developed world has been broken -- and the prevalence of air travel is part of what brought us to this point.
We are not through this yet: Vaccines are being distributed, but significant mutations have already been observed.
If these change the shape of surface proteins significantly, the current vaccines will not be effective against the new virus.

So, as you zoom out on each of these, trying to find some landmark you recognize,
be grateful for the world we share, treasure those portions you can walk to,
and hesitate before starting a journey that requires paving a space for you at the far side.
